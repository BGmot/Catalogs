This page describes how to add a new Sample to the Catalog.

## WORK IN PROGRESS!

## Overview

Start by reading the [Overview][add overview].

## Contributing to the Sample

Identify what repository you will want to contribute to, and its lead.

You are responsible for submitting a contribution agreement (if necessary), and
collaborating with the repository lead to secure appropriate technical and legal review.

Fork the appropriate repository and apply the changes needed.  Then submit a pull request.
Interact with the reviewers until the change is acceptable to all parties, at which point
it will be merged in.


## Updating the Catalog

You are responsible for updating the catalog, if necessary, whenever you update the sample.
This means two pull requests.

Fork the [Catalogs](http://github.com/blackberry/Catalogs) repository,
then modify the All_Samples.json file to reflect the new sample(s),
and submit a pull request.
